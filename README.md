# Stanford Lecture Code-Along

This repository contains a simplified, step-by-step python notebook designed to help you follow along with [this Stanford lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWNNt2KmfQ).

I had a lot of trouble understanding the lecture at first, so I created these notes and code samples to make the content more accessible.

It's vanilla so no external python libraries required
